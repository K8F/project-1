# Reading is Fun!

## About this project

In this project, our group created an app that allows teachers to create a reading list for students. The app has two main pages: the teacher portal and the student portal. 

Teachers can search for books, add to a reading list, and use a calendar to assign books. Students can request books and track their progress with stickers.

## How it works

Reading is Fun! is written with JavaScript. We used several additional technologies to create the app, including:
* JQuery for DOM manipulation
* Bootstrap for CSS styling
* Google Books API to search and retrieve books
* Giphy API to generate stickers
* Full Calendar Library Plugin for the calendar and book list
* Moment.js to help display due dates
* Google Firebase, to store and retrieve all of the information. 

We created several JavaScript files in order to manage the app's features. Most of the functionality for the Student Portal is documented on the app.js file. Each of the libraries and APIs we used have their own JavaScript files that call on each other for certain functiionality. 


## Future Improvements

We have started work on an additional feature that lets readers preview books with the Google Books API. We currently have the page built to search for books by ISBN, but we want to update the page so that it instead searches by key words.

## Known Issues

In some sections of the HTML, the boostrap library is preventing us from adding our own CSS styling. In those cases, we have hard-coded the style into the HTML.
